INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
=========================

JeVois-A33: To compile and install for host:
--------------------------------------------

./rebuild-host.sh


JeVois-A33: To cross-compile for platform hardware and install to staging area:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

./rebuild-platform.sh --staging

The package will be included next time you flash a custom microSD card using jevois-build.sh in jevois-sdk.

JeVois-A33: To cross-compile for platform hardware and install to jvpkg package:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

./rebuild-platform.sh
cd pbuild
make jvpkg
cd ..

Then just copy the resulting .jvpkg file to the JEVOIS:/packages/ folder on your microSD card. The JeVois smart camera
will unpack and install it next time it starts up.


JeVois-Pro: To compile and install for host:
--------------------------------------------

./rebuild-pro-host.sh


JeVois-Pro: To cross-compile for platform hardware and pack into a .deb package:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

./rebuild-pro-platform-pdeb.sh

this will create a .deb file for arm64 architecture (the processor of JeVois-Pro) that you can then copy to the
microSD of your JeVois-Pro and install on your running camera using the following command in the JeVois-Pro console:

!dpkg -i /location/of/debfile.deb
